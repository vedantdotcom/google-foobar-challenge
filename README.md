Google foobar challenge started on 2/2/2023

I got invited to do the Google foobar challenge after googling loss function examples for gradient boosting. This repo serves as a record of my progress on completing the challenges (if any) along with solutions. All credit for any borrowed code will be cited to the best of my recollection. Thank you for stopping by!
